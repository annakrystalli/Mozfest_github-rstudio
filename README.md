## Welcome to our [#Mozfest2016](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Mozfest2016&src=typd) session! :tada:


This practical session is designed for R users and aims to set beginners in version control up with some basic skills in using github through Rstudio to manage projects and collaborate online.


***

### **Session Roadmap**

<br>

#### **1. Introductions**

##### - **get to know the audience** (10 mis)
  - Shout outs and twitter polls.

##### - **[get to know github](https://annakrystalli.github.io/Mozfest_github-rstudio/index.html)** (25 mins)
  - github as a computational research tool

<br>

#### **2. Get stuck in**

#### - [Version control with github and rstudio](https://github.com/mikecroucher/ISBE_Symposium) (40 mins)
  - In this session, we are going to get you started with using version control from within RStudio.

  - The material is self-paced and includes a worked-example. It is suggested that you work through the sections in order.

#### - [Collaborative github through rstudio](https://annakrystalli.github.io/Mozfest_github-rstudio/evolottery.html) #EvoLottery (40 mins)

  - **Beak and skull shapes in birds of prey (“raptors”) are strongly coupled and largely controlled by size.** 

  - In this exercise, each participant will fork a github repo, and contribute a file required to simulate the **evolutionary trajectory of an imaginary species' body size**. 
  
  - We'll collate all species files and plot them all up together at the end! 
  
  - We'll also **discover the skull and beak shapes** associated with each simulated species size.
